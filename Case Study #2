# Data Analysis Case Study #2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. 
They carry out tests on various types of roadwaysâ€”specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. 
They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. 
The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions. 
Reflection

Reflection:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

Ethical methods encompass evaluating the autonomous vehicle prototype on diverse route configurations and gathering data from sensors and cameras. Unfair testing methods could limit testing to daytime hours, which could distort results and provide an incomplete picture of how the car performs in different lighting conditions.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

A data analyst could address unfair practices by suggesting or carrying out more testing at night to evaluate how well the prototype functions in dimly lit environments. For a more thorough assessment of the self-driving car's performance in various illumination conditions, the sensor and video data from these extra tests should be analyzed.
