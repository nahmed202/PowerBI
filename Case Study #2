Data Analyst Case Study #2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. 
They carry out the tests on various types of roadwaysâ€”specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. 
They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. 
The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions. 
Reflection

Consider this scenario:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

Fair practices include testing the self-driving car prototype on different types of roadways and collecting both sensor and video data. 
Unfair practices might involve only testing during the daytime, which could skew results and not fully represent the car's performance in varying lighting conditions.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

A data analyst could correct unfair practices by recommending or conducting additional tests during nighttime conditions to assess the 
prototype's performance in low-light situations. Analyzing the sensor and video data from these additional tests would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the self-driving car's capabilities across different lighting environments.
