# Data Analysis Case Study #3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to its property. 
First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. 
To understand their visitorsâ€™ interests, the park develops a survey. 

They decided to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors 
will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the 
respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, 
as most of their visitors prefer them.

Reflection:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

Surveys to learn visitor preferences are part of fair procedures. Unfair practices could include distributing the survey only in areas close to roller coasters, which could skew the results in favor of roller coasters because of the survey placement.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

By distributing the poll more equitably throughout the park's attractions or at different times of the day to gather a more representative sample of visitor preferences, a data analyst could address unfair practices. A more accurate picture of visitor interests would also be ensured by performing statistical analysis to account for potential biases in survey replies and validating findings through further surveys or techniques.
