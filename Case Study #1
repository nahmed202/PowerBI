# Data Analyst Case Study 1

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. 
They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. 
The data was collected via a student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. 
The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. 

The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

Reflection

    What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

    - Fair practices include offering the workshop voluntarily and collecting performance data through a standardized survey. 
      Unfair practices might involve not accounting for potential biases in survey responses or other factors that could 
      influence teacher performance beyond workshop attendance.


    How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

    - A data analyst could correct unfair practices by conducting a more comprehensive analysis that controls for variables like teaching              experience, subject taught, and student demographics. Additionally, using statistical techniques such as regression analysis to isolate          the impact of workshop attendance on teacher performance could provide a more accurate assessment of its effectiveness.
