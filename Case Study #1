# Data Analysis Case Study #1

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. 
They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. 
The data was collected via a student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. 
The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. 

The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

Reflection:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

Voluntary participation in the workshop and the use of a standardized survey to gather performance data are examples of fair practices. 
Injustices could include not taking into consideration survey respondents' possible biases or other variables that might affect teachers' performance in addition to workshop participation.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

By performing a more thorough study that accounts for characteristics like teacher experience, subject taught, and student demographics, a data analyst could address unfair practices. Furthermore, a more precise evaluation of the workshop's efficacy may be obtained by isolating the influence of workshop attendance on teacher performance using statistical methods like regression analysis.
